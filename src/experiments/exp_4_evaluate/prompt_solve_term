Here is a lambda term:
{term}

Your goal is to predict a right sequence of tactics in Rocq (using SSReflect) to generate a proof of this lemma.

Here is some constants that could be useful:
{constants}

Please read carefully the previous given elements, and infer the tactics.
Your goal is to predict the right tactic (using SSReflect in Coq). Think step by step, look at the lambda term to try to predict the right sequence of tactics.
