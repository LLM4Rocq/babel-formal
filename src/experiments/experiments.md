A set of experimentation scripts, used to generate various figures, and to provide a glimpse of some features of the dataset.

* exp_0: Histogram of the lengths of tokenized terms, and sequences of tactics (requires completion of step_2).
* exp_1: Scores of different reasonings for a given term (requires completion of step_3).
* exp_2: Histogram of different reasoning scores; to be used when there is a more diverse set of reasonings (requires completion of step_3).
* exp_3: Comparison between rankings obtained from LLM calls and reasoning scores.
* exp_4: Evaluation of LLMs on the task of translation.
