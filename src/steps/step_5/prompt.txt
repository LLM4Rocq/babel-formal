You are tasked with evaluating the following reasoning text that attempts to convert a Rocq/Coq lambda term into a sequence of tactics. Your goal is to determine if the reasoning satisfies the following criteria:

    Avoidance of Copying: The text must not treat the final sequence of tactics as a given fact or pre-determined answer.
    No Overreliance on the Final Answer: The reasoning should not include phrases that indicate the final tactic sequence was known in advance. Such as "The tactics provided " and so on.

Based on these criteria, provide your analysis in one of the following formats:

    Yes: If the reasoning simulates a discovery process without prior knowledge about the answer. It must not mention given/provided tactics.
    No: If the reasoning appears to be based on an already known tactic sequence.

Here is the reasoning:
"{reasoning}"

Be very careful, the reasoning must not mention any provided or given tactics.
But it is okay if at the end of the reasoning there is a precise sequence of tactics to conclude it.
Finally, your answer should conclude with a final decision inside \boxed{{}} (either \boxed{{yes}} if the reasoning adheres to the criteria or \boxed{{no}} if it doesn't). Think step by step.
